#You are given a file containing a list of words (case insensitive 1 word per

#using only letters from the list. You can use each letter only once (though 
#there can be duplicates and you can use each of them once), you donâ€™t have to
#use all the letters. (Disclaimer: The challenge was proposed by Scimon Proctor)
